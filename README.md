# ArDSKYlite
A **very lightweight recreation** of the venerable Apollo [DSKY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apollo_Guidance_Computer) using just an Arduino Uno and a 320x240 Touch LCD shield.  The LCD replaces all of the hardware complications (buttons, lights).

This is **not** a full simulation of the DSKY, just a taste of the Verb/Noun paradigm. There are a handful of verbs and nouns, for example:


Verb 16, Noun 36 (Monitor Decimal:Clock Time) makes the DSKY act as a clock (screen capture):

Verb 18, Noun 28 (Monitor Graphical:Moon Phase) shows the moon phase graphically (screen capture):

The main point is to replace the 15 lamps, 21 seven-segment digits and 19 push-buttons with the touch shield.  So not the full experience of das blinken lights, but much more accessible!
