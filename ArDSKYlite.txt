----- ArDSKYlite
A very, very lightweight approximation of the venerable DSKY.
Drastically simplified hardware, just a Uno and an LCD shield (and an RTC).
The code is in no way a simulation of the actual device, just enough to achieve the look and a sense of the experience (perhaps).

----- Basic operation
The DSKY has three parts: A panel of indicator lights at top left, a panel of 7-segment numeric displays at top right, and a keyboard area below.

The numeric panel has three 2-digit values, VERB, NOUN & PROG. Below that are three signed 5-digit "registers", R1, R2 & R3. Registers are displayed in decimal with a sign. Octal values lack the sign. This applies when entering values too; a decimal value must be started with '+' or '-', otherwise octal is assumed. Registers values must be entered with leading zeros, which are also displayed (but see Configuration).

The buttons are [VERB], [NOUN], [+], [-], [0]-[9], CLR (Clear), [PRO] (Proceed), [KEY REL] (Key Release), [ENTR] (Enter) and RSET (Reset).

Actions are performed by specifying Verbs (like "Display") and Nouns (like "Time"). Nouns and Verbs are identified by two-digit numbers.
For example to show the current time:
tap [Verb]
tap [0] and [6] (Verb #6 is "Display Decimal")
tap [Noun]
tap [3] and [6] (Noun #36 is "Clock Time")
'06' and '23' are displayed in the numbers panel under the corresponding labels
tap [ENTR]
The current hour, minutes and seconds are displayed on the three register lines. 
If an entry error occurs (for example an unsupported Noun) the OPR ERR (Operator error) lamp flashes and further entry is prohibited.  This condition can be cleared by tapping [RSET] or [CLR]

----- Verbs and Nouns
These are usually abbreviated Vnn and Nnn, so for example the above is abbreviated V06N36
A very limited set of Verbs and Nouns is supported. See https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/A17_VN_Checklist.png for an original list!

----- Verbs List
05: Display Octal. This displays the information specified by the Noun on 1, 2 or 3 registers, in octal.
06: Display Decimal. As above, but in decimal
15: Monitor Octal: and
16: Monitor Decimal: The same as the corresponding "Display" verbs, but these continue to update the value(s) until stopped by pressing [PRO] or [RSET] . These periodically flash COMP ACTY (Computer Activity).
18: Monitor Graphical: See Moon Phase
25: Enter Data: Enters the value(s) specified by the Noun. When running, the Verb and Noun numbers flash.
35: Lamp Test:  This turns on/flashes all the indicator lights and displays '8's on the numeric displays.  The Verb is ignored. 
50: Please Perform: A RPN calculator, see N9x
99: Engine Ignition: Just fakes it :-)

----- Noun List
24: Uptime: This represents the total hours (R1), minutes (R2) and seconds (R3) the device has been running. These values can be reset with V25N24
28: Moon Phase: The phase of the moon.  See Moon Phase
29: Auto-run: The Verb (R1) and Noun (R2) to automatically execute at startup.  Enter zero(s) to disable.
30: Output Flags:see Configuration
31: Input Flags:see Configuration
36: Clock Time: The current time, hours (R1), minutes (R2) and seconds (R3). The time is in 24-hour mode and the numbers have leading 0's (but see Configuration)
39: Clock Date: The current year (R1), month (R2) and day of the month (R3), in that order and with leading 0's (but see Configuration)
9x: Stack Operations. There is a 10-number stack, V50N9x performs the following stack operations on it 
90:Clear, 91:Push, 92:Pop, 93:Dup, 94:Add, 95:Sub, 96:Mult, 97:Div, 98:Neg, 99:Swap. 
N06N9x shows the top of the stack.

Thus for example V16N36 (Monitor Decimal:Clock Time) makes the DSKY act as a clock. V18N28 (Monitor Graphical:Moon Phase) shows the moon phase graphically. 
You could use V25N29 to have these start running when the device is turned on.
Some verbs/nouns are based on real DSKY verbs & nouns, others are made up for this project.

----- Availability
Not all are available all the time. If USE_MOON_GRAPHICS is defined in the code, the Moon will be drawn in detail but there's no room for V50N9x and V99. If it's not defined, the Moon is a simple disk but V50N9x and V99 are available.

----- Moon Phase
When displaying/monitoring numbers, this is the age of the moon in R1 (days since the last New Moon).  
When entering values, provide, D, H and M in R1, R2, R3, where D is the calendar days from today until the next New Moon and H:M is the time of the New Moon.
The Monitor Graphical verb draws a representation of the current moon phase along with some other information. Note that this is approximate, based on a fixed average period of ~29.5 days.

----- Configuration
Output Flags, N30, is best entered (and displayed) in Octal (i.e. no leading sign) it consists of 5 Octal digits: 0wxyz
w: controls the hemisphere (how the moon is rendered).  If this digit is non-zero, the Northern Hemisphere is used, otherwise Southern
x: controls the time format. If this digit is non-zero, the time is displayed in 24-hour mode, otherwise 12-hour. Input is always 24-hour.
y: controls leading 0 display. If this digit is non-zero, decimal register values are displayed with leading 0's, otherwise without. Input always requires leading 0's.
z controls the date format.  If this digit is 1, the format is DMY, if 2:MDY, otherwise YMD. Input is always YMD.
The default is 001110 (North, 24-hour, leading 0's, YMD)

Input Flags, N31, is best entered (and displayed) in Octal (i.e. no leading sign) it consists of 1 Octal digit: 0000z
z controls the button behaviour.  If this digit is non-zero, the buttons flash when pressed.  This is the default.
